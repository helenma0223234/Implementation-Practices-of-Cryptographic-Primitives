# Implementation-Practices-of-Cryptographic-Primitives

This repo contains implementations of selective cryptographic primitives and algorithms (e.g. CTR, el-gamal .etc).

The code was written during an applied cryptography class at Dartmouth taught by Prof Sean Smith.

## To use
Make sure to have openssl(https://www.openssl.org) installed.
